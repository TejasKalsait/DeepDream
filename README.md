## 1) Introduction
Welcome to the DeepDream Project! This Streamlit web application allows you to create mesmerizing and artistic images using the DeepDream algorithm. DeepDream is a computer vision algorithm developed by Google that enhances images by iteratively amplifying patterns it detects in the image.

With this web application, you can upload your own images or use the pre-loaded ones to apply the DeepDream algorithm. You have control over the layers and iterations, allowing you to fine-tune the dreamy effect as per your preferences.

## 2) Demo
Check out the live demo of the DeepDream Project here: DeepDream Web App

https://dreamer-ai.streamlit.app/

## 3) Features
Upload your own images.
Control the layers and iterations of the DeepDream algorithm.
Visualize and save the dreamy results.

## 4) How to Use
Visit the live demo link: https://dreamer-ai.streamlit.app/
Once the web application loads, you will see the main interface.
Click on the "Upload Image" button to select an image from your local machine.
Adjust the "Layers" and "Iterations" sliders to customize the DeepDream effect.
Click on the "Generate!" button to apply the DeepDream algorithm and visualize the result.
If you are satisfied with the outcome, you can download the dreamy image using the "Download" button.
