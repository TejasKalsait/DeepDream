## Introduction
Welcome to the DeepDream Project! This Streamlit web application allows you to create mesmerizing and artistic images using the DeepDream algorithm. DeepDream is a computer vision algorithm developed by Google that enhances images by iteratively amplifying patterns it detects in the image.

With this web application, you can upload your own images or use the pre-loaded ones to apply the DeepDream algorithm. You have control over the layers and iterations, allowing you to fine-tune the dreamy effect as per your preferences.
